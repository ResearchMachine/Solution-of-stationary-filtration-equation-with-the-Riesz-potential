### I. Motivation
Diffusion models are used in a wide range of applications, such as [market forecasting](https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=engscheleart2) or oil production forecasting. Models with memory have appeared relatively recently and are used in a wide range of tasks. The combination of these approaches makes it possible to carry out a forecast taking into account nonlocality in coordinates.

### II. Problem
The main purpose of this work is derivation and debugging of a computational algorithm for a new diffusion model. The main difficulty is the presence of a singularity in the operator.


### III. Key Results 
A computational method for a new predictive model of hydrodynamics with memory has been developed and implemented. The computational problem of the model and the solution method are highlighted. 

* Numerical scheme is constructed for the steady case;
* Explicit numerical scheme for non-steady equation is constructed.  
  

### III. Content
Radial steady-state fluid flow model for porous media with the Riesz potential is considered. A numerical scheme for model with one-dimensional representation of the Riesz potential is presented. Regularity and monotonicity of solution of the Dirichlet boundary value problem corresponding to the constant pressure in the bottomhole zone are discussed.
